# morse-code-translator
Morse code translator for the Raspberry Pi Pico Maker Board
## To build and compile project (Windows)
Firstly make sure there is no build folder inside of the root directory. Once done, run build-project.bat and it will automatically buidl the project as well as compile it to make the .uf2 file in /build/morse-code-translator.
## To monitor the recognised letters
Open up Device Manager and expand the ports option and record the COM number for the pico, for example, mine is COM5. Then, open up PuTTY and connect to the currect port, and you will be able to use the console.
